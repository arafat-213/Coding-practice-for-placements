/*
* The idea is to use square sum relation of Pythagorean triplet,
* i.e., addition of squares of a and b is equal to square of c,
* we can write these number in terms of m and n such that,
* a = m^2 - n^2
       b = 2 * m * n
       c  = m^2 + n^2
because,
       a^2 = m^4 + n^4 â€“ 2 * m^2 * n^2
       b^2 = 4 * m^2 * n^2
       c^2 = m^4 + n^4 + 2* m^2 * n^2
